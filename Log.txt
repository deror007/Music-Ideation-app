ANNOTATE AND CHANGE VARIABLES:

-Managed to display staves onto music draw functionality. BUT unsure if the staves will scale to different screen sizes.

But for final release mainActivity.xml and .java need to be for the entire program not just the draw area function.

This code is the same as the one on geeks for geeks. Must change up the logic!
